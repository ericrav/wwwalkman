 0. The Critical Engineer considers Engineering to be the most transformative language of our time, shaping the way we move, communicate and think. It is the work of the Critical Engineer to study and exploit this language, exposing its influence.


 1. The Critical Engineer considers any technology depended upon to be both a challenge and a threat. The greater the dependence on a technology the greater the need to study and expose its inner workings, regardless of ownership or legal provision.


 2. The Critical Engineer raises awareness that with each technological advance our techno-political literacy is challenged.


 3. The Critical Engineer deconstructs and incites suspicion of rich user experiences.


 4. The Critical Engineer looks beyond the "awe of implementation" to determine methods of influence and their specific effects.


 5. The Critical Engineer recognises that each work of engineering engineers its user, proportional to that user's dependency upon it.
